<h2> Description </h2>
<p>Web application (now only supports firefox and chrome) that enables you to write on a fogged mirror, displaying you (off course)</p>

<h2> How to use </h2>
<p>It's very simple to use. Just open the index.html in Chrome and start writing. </p>

<h2> More info, ideas, etcetera </h2>
<p>I made it in one hour, but the code is quite clear. </p>
<p>I don't know what I'm going to use it for right now, but I have some ideas. </p>
<p>In the future, I see many applications:
It could be used for...</p>
<ul>
<li>a background for a blogging platform.</li>
<li>a chatting application.</li>
<li>for writing in a diary. </li>
</ul>
<p>It'd be cool to...</p>
<ul>
<li> add a function that records the user while writing things. </li>
<li> create an export to .txt-file function. </li>
<li> add background noises. </li>
<li>change the color of the background during the writing. </li>
</ul>
<p>
...if you know something else, comment or build it yourself:).
