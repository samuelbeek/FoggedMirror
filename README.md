FoggedMirror
============

DESCRIPTION:
Web application (now only supports firefox and chrome) that enables you to write on a fogged mirror, displaying you (off course)

HOW TO USE:
It's very simple to use. Just open the index.html in Chrome and start writing. 

MORE INFORMATION: 
I made it in one hour, but the code is quite clear. 

I don't know what I'm going to use it for right now, but I have some ideas. 

In the future, I see many applications: 
It could be used for...
a background for a blogging platform.
a chatting application.
for writing in a diary. 

It'd be cool to...
add a function that records the user while writing things. 
create an export to .txt-file function.
add background noises.
change the color of the background during the writing. 
...if you know something else, comment or build it yourself:). 

I hope to inspire some people!
